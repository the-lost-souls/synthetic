                      ---------- SYNTHETIC -----------

                     released at the Tonstad Party 1995

        Just wanna thank Axon and Hobbes for all help here at this sucking
party. Also want to thank Ghoul for help on different things, and all those
other I have bothered with my stupid coding-questions on BBS's.

        Don't like to say it, but this party was very lousy organized! What
organizers doesn't come up with their own PC to the compo?!? Using the 
PC of a participator?!?
        Anyway. The intro was coded for about half a year ago, and I like
to think I'm capable of something better now. The whole intro is coded in
assembler, and the routines are very slow.

        To hear the music, you need a Sound Blaster 16 or a GUS. The intro
can't be run if you don't have a soundcard, but the intro will be even worse
without music... The module itself is originally a S3M and uses 12 channels.
Of course it will be slow on a Sound Blaster...
